## Board Game Sharing System – Project Scope
🎲 The Board Game Sharing System is a Java-based application designed for board game enthusiasts to connect, share games, and organize events. The application supports two types of users: Players and Game Owners. Players can browse available board games, register for events, and request to borrow games, while Game Owners can manage their game collections, approve or decline borrowing requests, and track lending history.
### Key Features:
+ **Secure Access & User Roles** – User authentication is required, and users can switch between Player and Game Owner roles.
+ **Game Library** – A centralized collection of board games where users can browse available titles and see their owners.
+ **Game Lending & Tracking** – Players can request to borrow games, and Game Owners can approve, decline, and monitor their lending history.
+ **Event Creation & Participation** – Users can schedule board game events, set details such as date and location, and allow other users to register.
+ **Community Feedback & Reviews** – Users can share their experiences by leaving reviews for board games they’ve played.
### Technology Stack:
+ **Backend:** Java, Spring Boot, Hibernate (ORM), REST API
+ **Database:** PostgreSQL
+ **Frontend:** Vue.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
  
This project is focused on providing a seamless experience for board game enthusiasts by enabling easy game sharing and event organization. Future enhancements may include additional social features or advanced search and filtering options.
